Post-meeting notes.
Fan: Is there specific need? Like a medical need? Will we move the needle with
a home monitoring system? We hypothesize there is a need. If there is a need,
then what is the "pain point"? Is there a market need? If there is not a need,
then will we need to move forward with an academic approach? Where will we get
funding? We do not want to go out-of-pocket. Perhaps grants?
