Notes:
Show graphs and audio.
Identify features such as frequency, power, and variance
Develop a model that correlates features with urinary flow rate and volume

Graphs slide:
Using the microphone, we aim to acquire audio tracks of a user's urinary
activities in order to quantify the urinary output and flow rate.

A major challenge in this process is to be able to extract the relevant
signals from the audio because the signal and the noise often occupy similar
frequency ranges.

However, we were able to design a custom filter and apply it to our audio
tracks to not only reduce noise but also enhance the relevant signals by
focusing on and weighing different sections of the frequency spectra (as shown
here).

As you can see, after we apply the filter on a low flow rate signal and a high
flow rate signal, we can identify significant differences in the resulting
spectra.

Now we will demonstrate our filtering process with an audio example.
