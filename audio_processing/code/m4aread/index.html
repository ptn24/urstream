%% M4A (AAC) Compressed Audio File Reading
%
% The function <m4aread.m m4aread> serves as a drop-in replacement for 
% wavread to read audio files that are encoded in AAC (also 
% known as MPEG4 Audio, or m4a files).  The Matlab wrapper 
% actually hands off the work to faad, the open-source AAC 
% decoder.  Binaries for faad are widely available (and may be
% included in this distribution).  By virtue of the support 
% provided within faad, m4aread can also read mp4 video files 
% directly and return the soundtrack.
%
% So far as possible, m4aread accepts the same options as wavread 
% e.g. to read only a subset of samples etc.  See "help m4aread".
%
% m4aread is based on my Matlab code for reading mp3 files,
% <http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/matlab/mp3read.html mp3read>.
%
% m4aread pays particular attention to the handling of very large
% audio files; it is possible to load a small part of a file that,
% if read in its entirety, would not fit into memory.  You can also
% downsample as part of reading, and the peak memory requirement is
% dictated by the post-downsampling segment, not its size prior to
% downsampling. 

%% Example usage
% Here, we read in an AAC file, plot is spectrogram, then write 
% it out in WAV format.  We then show how we can read just a
% portion of the file, force it to be mono, and downsample on
% reading. 

% Read an audio waveform
[d,sr] = m4aread('piano.m4a');
% Plot the spectrogram
subplot(211)
specgram(d(:,1),1024,sr);
% Save as a wav file
wavwrite(d,sr,'piano.wav');
% What is the original size and sampling rate?
size(d)
sr
% Read with downsampling, sample range restriction, and forced
% single channel
firstsamp = 10001;
lastsamp = 20000;
forcemono = 1;
downsamp = 2; % 2:1 downsampling
[d,sr] = m4aread('piano.m4a',[firstsamp lastsamp],forcemono,downsamp);
size(d)
sr
% What did that give us?
subplot(212)
specgram(d,512,sr);

%% External binaries
% The m file relies on an external binary, faad, which is 
% available for Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows.  See
% http://www.audiocoding.com/

%% Installation
% You can download a zip file containing m4aread.m, the other files
% used in this demo, and faad binaries for several platforms, from 
% <http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/resources/matlab/m4aread/m4aread.zip m4aread.zip>.
%
% m4aread will look for its binary, faad, in 
% the same directory where it is installed.  Binaries for
% different architectures are distinguished by their extension, 
% which is the standard Matlab computer code e.g. ".maci64" for 
% MacOS 10.6 and ".glnxa64" for 64-bit  Linux.  The exception is 
% Windows, where the binaries have the extension ".exe".  
%
% Temporary files 
% will be written to (a) a directory taken from the environment 
% variable TMPDIR (b) /tmp if it exists, or (c) the current 
% directory.  This can easily be changed by editing the m file.
